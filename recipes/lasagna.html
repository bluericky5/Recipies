        Ingredients:

12 lasagna noodles
1 lb ground beef
1/2 onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 jar (24 oz) of spaghetti sauce
1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp dried basil
1/4 tsp dried oregano
1/4 tsp dried parsley
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1 egg
1 container (15 oz) ricotta cheese
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and set aside.

In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is translucent.

Add the spaghetti sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, basil, oregano, parsley, and garlic powder. Bring to a simmer and let cook for 15 minutes.

In a medium bowl, beat the egg and then stir in the ricotta cheese.

To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread 1/2 of the ricotta mixture on top of the noodles, and then sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers with the remaining noodles, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella cheese.

Top with the remaining meat sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.

Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!
