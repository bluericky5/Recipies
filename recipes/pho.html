<h1>Pho</h1>
<p>
    Ingredients:

2 lbs beef bones
2 onions, halved
4 inch piece of ginger, halved lengthwise
4 star anise
4 whole cloves
1 cinnamon stick
1 tablespoon coriander seeds
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
2-3 quarts of water
1 lb of beef, sliced thinly
8 oz of dried rice noodles
1 bunch of scallions, thinly sliced
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped
1/2 cup fresh Thai basil, roughly chopped
1/2 cup fresh mint, roughly chopped
2 limes, cut into wedges
Hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce, and fish sauce to taste
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C). Spread the beef bones in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes, turning them over halfway through.

Add the roasted beef bones, onions, and ginger to a large pot. Add enough water to cover the bones by 2-3 inches.

Bring the water to a boil over high heat and then reduce to a simmer. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the top.

Add the star anise, cloves, cinnamon stick, coriander seeds, and fennel seeds to the pot. Let the broth simmer for 3-4 hours, adding more water if needed.

Remove the beef bones, onions, and ginger from the pot and strain the broth through a fine mesh sieve. Discard any solids.

Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the rice noodles. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are tender. Drain and rinse the noodles with cold water.

To assemble the Pho bowls, divide the cooked noodles among 4-6 bowls. Add a few slices of beef to each bowl.

Pour the hot broth over the noodles and beef.

Serve with the scallions, cilantro, basil, mint, lime wedges, and sauces on the side. Let each person customize their own Pho bowl to their liking.
